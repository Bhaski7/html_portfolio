    <h1><u><i>Plot Summary</i></u></h1>
    <p><i>
        "12 Angry Men" is a courtroom drama centered on a jury deliberating the guilt or innocence of a teenage boy accused of murdering his father. Directed by Sidney Lumet, the film takes place almost entirely in the jury room, where the twelve jurors must reach a unanimous decision.
    
        <br><br>At the start, eleven jurors are convinced of the boy's guilt, with only Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) expressing doubt. He argues that they owe it to the boy to discuss the case in detail before condemning him to death. Through methodical examination of the evidence and testimonies, Juror 8 raises reasonable doubts about the prosecution's case.
        
        <br><br>As the deliberation progresses, biases, personal issues, and preconceptions of the jurors are revealed. Juror 8's calm and logical approach gradually persuades others to reconsider their positions. Key pieces of evidence, such as the murder weapon and witness testimonies, are scrutinized, leading to revelations that undermine the certainty of the boy's guilt.
        
        <br><br>The film highlights themes of justice, prejudice, and moral responsibility. By the end, the jury reaches a unanimous verdict of "not guilty," underscoring the importance of due process and reasonable doubt in the judicial system. The movie ends with the jurors leaving the courthouse, their perspectives forever changed by the intense deliberation.
