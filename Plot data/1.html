    <h1><u><i>Plot summary</i></u></h1>
<p><i>
    "The Shawshank Redemption" is a drama based on Stephen King's novella "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption." The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Sentenced to life at Shawshank State Penitentiary, Andy befriends fellow inmate Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), a long-time convict who procures contraband for the prisoners.

<br><br>
Over the years, Andy maintains hope and dignity despite the harsh realities of prison life. He gains the trust of the prison staff by offering financial advice, eventually helping the corrupt warden, Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton), launder money. Using his skills, Andy improves the library and helps other inmates earn high school diplomas.

<br><br>
Unknown to others, Andy works on a secret plan to escape. After nearly two decades, he escapes through a tunnel he meticulously dug behind a poster in his cell. He exposes the warden's corruption by mailing evidence to a local newspaper, leading to the warden's downfall. Andy then flees to Mexico, where Red eventually joins him after being paroled. The film ends with their joyful reunion on a beach in Zihuatanejo.
